### Steps ###
1. Set up x tables
2. Label each table
3. Explain to the students that the end goal is to guide students from table x to table x
4. In order to pass a station, students must complete all the prompts for each coding station then tested on those prompts via live coding, proctored by the instructor. 
  - Each coding work station is worth [10 points].
  - Each student gets 30 minutes to complete prompts from the instructor
5. Once the student has completed a coding work station and passed the live coding test move student to the next table.

### Coding Workstations Â© ðŸ’»: ###
The following are links to my coding work stations. Coding work stations are comprised of small repetitive coding prompts. The intent is to provide students with kinesthetic learning types, an opportunity to get their hands dirty and acquire a level of competency with Javascript fundamentals that will, in turn, mature our fellows into problem solvers and get a fair shot @ solving the Fullstack Academy assessment.
